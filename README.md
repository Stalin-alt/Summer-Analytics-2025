# Summer-Analytics-2025

model 1, model 2, model 3 are for final capstone project.

In this repository I have given submissions for three different machine learning models developed as part of the Summer Analytics Capstone project. Each model addresses a specific problem statement and demonstrates a unique approach, using various data science and machine learning techniques. My goal was to showcase model development, evaluation, and deployment readiness in a reproducible and collaborative manner.

Tech Stacks : 
-Programming Language: Python 3
-Data Analysis & Manipulation: pandas, numpy, pathway
-Machine Learning Frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pathway
-Visualization: matplotlib, Bokeh
-Notebook Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
-Version Control: Git, GitHub

Data Collection :

Datasets are sourced from provided files or public repositories.
Data is loaded into the notebook environment for processing.
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning.

Feature engineering: encoding categorical variables, normalization, or scaling as needed.

Model Development
Model 1:This model provides a quick, interpretable baseline for price estimation based on real-time occupancy, suitable for initial deployment or as a benchmark for more advanced models.

Model 2: This model is suitable for environments where pricing must react to a blend of operational and contextual factors in real time. It enables nuanced price adjustments based on current demand signals, helping optimize resource utilization and revenue.

Model 3: This model is suitable for complex, real-world scenarios where multiple factors and competitive dynamics influence pricing. It enables localized, responsive pricing strategies that can adapt to both feature-driven and spatial market conditions.

Evaluation & Metrics
