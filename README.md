# Summer-Analytics-2025

In this repository I have given submissions for three different machine learning models developed as part of the Summer Analytics Capstone project. Each model addresses a specific problem statement and demonstrates a unique approach, using various data science and machine learning techniques. My goal was to showcase model development, evaluation, and deployment readiness in a reproducible and collaborative manner.

Tech Stacks : 
-Programming Language: Python 3
-Data Analysis & Manipulation: pandas, numpy, pathway
-Machine Learning Frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pathway
-Visualization: matplotlib, Bokeh
-Notebook Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
-Version Control: Git, GitHub

Data Collection :

Datasets are sourced from provided files or public repositories.
Data is loaded into the notebook environment for processing.
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning.

Feature engineering: encoding categorical variables, normalization, or scaling as needed.

Model Development
Model 1:This model provides a quick, interpretable baseline for price estimation based on real-time occupancy, suitable for initial deployment or as a benchmark for more advanced models.
Model 2: Regression (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost Regressor)
Model 3: This model is suitable for complex, real-world scenarios where multiple factors and competitive dynamics influence pricing. It enables localized, responsive pricing strategies that can adapt to both feature-driven and spatial market conditions.
Each model is trained on the processed dataset with relevant hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation & Metrics
Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Regression: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score.
Clustering: Silhouette Score, Inertia, Cluster Visualization.
Visualizations for model performance and feature importance.
Results & Reporting
Summary of findings for each model.
Comparative analysis and discussion of results.
Deployment (Optional)
Exporting models as .pkl files.
Example scripts for inference or API integration.
